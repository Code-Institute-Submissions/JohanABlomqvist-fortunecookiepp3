# Features Left to Implement

- None as of now

# Testing and Bugs
- Had problems when trying to get google sheets to communicate with python properly for the app, upon further inspection I had not set up my scopes in my code properly, managed to get that in and working after a few tries.
- Authentication set up to google sheets API was not set properly and json file was not properly introduced to the python or directory here. 
- Other then that I tried making an adventure game before this in 3 different iterations, failed all off them and felt I did not have time to fix syncing datasheet with the projects and get syntax errors and other issues in order. This was the easier option to make out of the options I had, but it work's. 

## Unfixed bugs
- None that I know of.

# Validator Testing 

- Python
- I get the following syntax error when running it through a python checker, but code work exactly like intended without issues when running.
 Syntax errors detected :

Line 50:
worksheet.update_cell(i, 10, f"{name}: {fortune}")
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

## Full testing
In the testing phase I tried breaking the app in any way I could think of, empty input, spaces, using !"#%Â¤# letter, number for example. I just get wrong input, please try again. so I think I made it foolproof, but I could be wrong. I did this in both the name in-put and the y/n prompts. 
Also friends from the course did some testing too and the document saved the testing they did when they did the correct inputs in the document like this

![Settings](https://github.com/JohanABlomqvist/fortunecookiepp3/blob/c475015d2d1872e244efe45897a25058a194719a/assets/images/heroku1.PNG)
- Set up your config vars, KEY should be named CREDS and copy the creds.json file information into VALUE and save. 
- Under that is buildpacks, add thease two in this order shown on the picture.
