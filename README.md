## Full testing
To fully test my website I did the following tests using different browsers (google chrome, mozilla firefox) and devices (Samsung s21pro).
I went through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that they responsive on all different screen sizes.

Links
- Tested my social links on index.html, clicking popped out a new tab with the requested site as expected , both on mobile, mozilla, firefox, chrome and opera.
Game
- Tried completing the game on above said browsers and it did work like intended, clicked all the buttons and they also work like intended. 
- Ship drag does work for mobile, did not have time to implement mobile viability into the game after squishing out bugs for a minimal working product.
- Found a problem where you can click the start game button many times enabling the computer so shoot as many times as you clicked after each turn.
so I made the button hide until ships are placed on the board and disappear again after being clicked.
